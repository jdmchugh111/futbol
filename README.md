## Futbol

# Scheduled Check-Ins
Every weekday at 8:30am MT before class to discuss new code and merge all pending PRs.

# Project Organization / Workflow
Every day we will do a 3 driver/1 float model, where 3 different coders are working on different sections of project functionality, and one person is there to hop in when needed. The float can work on exercises/prep for IC when they're not coding or helping a teammate. We are using the github projects board to keep a running checklist of the methods that have already been coded for. Here is the link: https://github.com/users/jdmchugh111/projects/1

# Different Approaches
We discussed as a group our preferred workflows, and ultimately decided to do a hybrid of async and driver/navigator. By having 3 drivers per day, we maximize productivity, allow for async indpendent exploration, but also have the option to loop in a partner(s) as needed to do paired/team coding.

# Project Design
We discussed having the three statistics categories (Game, League, Season) separated out into modules. This way, we can have the different categories of stat methods more organized, and also avoid potential merge conflicts.

# Things That Went Well
1. Consitent, clear, and prompt communication (both in Slack and Github)
2. Good Git Workflow (a lot of line-specific commenting); also, met regularly to discuss prs, merge them and deal with all merge conflicts as a group
3. Feedback was given in a constructive and actionable way, but still always respectful

# Things We Would Do Differently
1. Creating a more uniform commit style - making sure we're on the same page about when and how often to commit
2. Create a naming system for new branches - branch names were easy enough to understand but could have been more methodical
3. Knowing what we know now about the amount of coding required for Iteration 2, we likely would have split up the code into smaller assigned chunks when we started the process
